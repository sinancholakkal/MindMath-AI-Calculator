Math AI aims to solve real-world limitations of traditional calculators by delivering a smarter and more intuitive calculation experience. The application leverages AI-assisted recognition to help users calculate mathematical expressions accurately and efficiently. By combining image recognition, intelligent parsing, and user-friendly interaction, Math AI enhances how users solve mathematical problems in everyday scenarios.

Overview

Math AI is an AI-powered calculator that recognizes and evaluates mathematical expressions from images. Users can capture handwritten or printed mathematical expressions using the device camera, and the app automatically detects, interprets, and calculates the result.

The application is designed to simplify complex calculations and provide a modern, intelligent alternative to conventional calculators.

How It Works

The user captures an image of a mathematical expression using the camera.

The image is processed using machine learning–based text and symbol recognition.

The recognized expression is parsed and evaluated.

The calculated result is displayed instantly to the user.

This process works seamlessly without requiring constant internet access.

Features

AI-powered image recognition
Automatically detects and calculates mathematical expressions from images, including handwritten and printed formats.

Offline support
Core calculation and recognition features work without an internet connection.

Advanced search capabilities
Supports extracting and calculating expressions from images, PDFs, web content, and handwritten notebook notes.

Voice command support
Allows users to perform calculations and search mathematical expressions using voice input.

Basic arithmetic operations
Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root operations, and editable calculation queries.

How to Use Math AI

Capture a mathematical expression using the camera or import it from supported sources.

Use voice commands or manual input to perform calculations.

Edit and refine detected expressions before final evaluation for improved accuracy.
